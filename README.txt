Discord Weather bot that takes in a location after the "!weather" command is used.

Utilizes discord API, as well as discord.py in order to interact with the discord channel.

Utilizes Openweathermap API in order to access weather data from all over the world.

Users can enter either location or zip code and the bot will return the following:

Description of the general weather, temperature in farenheit, what it feels like outside in farenheit, wind speed in mph,
humidity percentage, cloudiness percentage, and finally sunset time in eastern standard time.

Examples of the bot being used for various locations can be found in the examples folder on my github repo.
